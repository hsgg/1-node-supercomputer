# The Stetson-Harrison method

The Stetson-Harrison method is a way to estimate values statistically from a
prior distribution. The method does not assume that the prior follows the true
distribution.

The Stetson-Harrison method is not robust, in the sense that it is possible to
generate mock data where the method fails to give an accurate estimate.
