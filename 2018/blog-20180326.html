<h1>Using Apple's SuperDrive with Archlinux</h1>

<p>
Apple doesn't like to play nice with others. Their SuperDrive is no exception.
</p>
<p>
However, by sending some magic numbers to the drive you can make it <a
href="https://christianmoser.me/use-apples-usb-superdrive-with-linux/">work</a>.
You need the package <tt>sg3_utils</tt>. Then send the magic byte sequence to
the drive:
<blockquote><tt>
$ sg_raw /dev/sr0 EA 00 00 00 00 00 01
</tt></blockquote>
That's it! The aforementioned link also contain instructions on how to automate
the command using <tt>udev</tt> rules, if you're into that.
