# Using Apple's SuperDrive with Archlinux

Apple doesn't like to play nice with others. Their SuperDrive is no exception.

However, by sending some magic numbers to the drive you can make it <a

You need the package <tt>sg3_utils</tt>. Then send the magic byte sequence to
the drive:

	$ sg_raw /dev/sr0 EA 00 00 00 00 00 01
That's it! The aforementioned link also contain instructions on how to automate
the command using <tt>udev</tt> rules, if you're into that.
