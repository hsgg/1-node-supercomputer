# Compiling Evince on Archlinux

So, took me a while to figure out why <i>Evince</i> wouldn't compile.
<tt>autogen.sh</tt> gave me an error:

	error: HAVE_INTROSPECTION does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL

To solve it, install the package <tt>gobject-introspectiron</tt>. Yes, you need
that package even if you are compiling <i>Evince</i> without GObject
introspectrion support.
