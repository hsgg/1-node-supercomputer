# Parts List for Singer 327K Sewing Machine

The Singer 327K is a sewing machine. If it is missing a part, you may be
wondering, which part? And are there more parts missing?

To the rescue comes the parts list. Where to get it from? Some companies sell
you parts list. However, it seems that Singer puts the parts lists of its old
machines free available on the net. They are just a bit difficult to find.
Thus, without further ado, here it is: 
<a href="http://parts.singerco.com/CPpartCharts/3_39999/327K.pdf">327K</a>
<a href="http://parts.singerco.com/CPpartCharts/3_39999/328K.pdf">328K</a>
<a href="http://parts.singerco.com/CPpartCharts/3_39999/329K.pdf">329K</a>.
Yes, quite systematic the folks at singerco.com. I also included the parts lists
for the 328K and 329K models, because they use a lot of the same parts. Hence,
you can easily check if a part, say, advertized to fit model 328K also fits
model 327K.

Finally, the <a

is online as well, and a manual for the full family of

If anyone knows where to get the service manual, let me know.

Oh, and in case you were wondering what the 'K' suffix means on the model
number. It indicates where the machine was manufactured. 'K' stands for, uh...
ah..., a place in Scotland. Forgot the exact name. But that is easy to find
out. Much easier than finding the parts list.
