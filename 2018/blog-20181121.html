<h1>Word-wise git diff, number-wise git diff</h1>

<p>
Ah, one of those gems that make your life easier. Git allows you to do a
word-by-word diff, and you don't need to use a special tool for it:
<blockquote><tt>
$ git diff --word-diff
</tt></blockquote>
This will show the old word in red, the new replacement in green, if color is
enabled.
</p>

<p>
For number comparison it is better to reduce the amount difference even further:
<blockquote><tt>
$ git diff --word-diff-regex=.
</tt></blockquote>
This will show the difference character-by-character, which is pretty much what
you want when comparing numbers, and you expect only changes of order machine
precision.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it doesn't parse numbers, e.g. <tt>168898766763e-21</tt> is not
automatically matched with <tt>1.68898766763e-5</tt> (or whatever it is).
Nevertheless, still an improvement over the full number.
