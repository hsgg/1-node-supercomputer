# What's *artgerecht* in English?

It appears there is no word in English for the German *artgerecht*. My phone's
dictionary says:

	artgerecht: ensuring animal welfare by satisfying the specific
	requirements of the species held

Google translate is not bad by translating it literally:

	species-appropriate

[Leo](https://dict.leo.org/german-english/artgerecht) shows the mess of the
English language. It has several translations for *artgerechte Tierhaltung*:

	animal welfare
	adequate animal housing
	species-appropriate animal husbandry
	welfare oriented animal husbandry
	ethical husbandry
	humane husbandry

Alright, so there are options.

Why did I look into this? Oftentimes the concepts of sustainability and
species-appropriate husbandry are mixed together. In my opinion it is better to
clearly separate them. Not that I think you should, but you could sustainably
and in an environmentally friendly manner keep slaves or torture animals.

Mixing the concepts leads to unclear thinking. When mixing the terms, you need
to tease out the baggage that the other concept brings, and people will wonder,
what is this nonsense so-called *sustainability*? A word that poorly describes
your cause does a disservice to furthering the ideal of sustainability, ethical
manufacturing, and species-appropriate animal husbandry.

Another comment on the English language: Why so complicated? We should be able
to use the same word for ethical manufacturing and species-appropriate animal
husbandry. In the first case, I measn to apply it to humans, in the second case
to any animal. Is there a better way to phrase this?
