# 2020 Campaign Fundraising

Who is raising more money, Joe Biden (D) or Donald Trump (R)? The Democrats or
the Republicans?

According to [BallotPedia][1], Biden raised about $822 million, and Trump $558
million.

However, there are also the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican
National Committee (RNC), as well as DSCC, DCCC, NRSC, NRCC. Let's add them to
the mix, again using [Ballotpedia][2]. The DNC raised $357 million, DCCC $278
million, DSCC $209 million. The RNC got $604 million, NRCC $214 million, NRSC
$200 million.

Let's add them together. For the democratic committees that is $844 million,
and $1,018 million for the republican committees.

Also adding the presidential candidate's funding, we get $1.666 billion for the
democrats, and $1.576 billion for the republicans. Is it valid to add these
numbers together like that? I am assuming so.

So the difference is a "mere" $90 million, or about 5.6%.

Now, I don't know enough about campaign finance to see if there is something
wrong with my logic. I assume the money is all sepaparately raised, there are
no other funds I am ignoring, and, above all, I split the country into D- and
R-type people. Any of these might not be accurate assumptions.
