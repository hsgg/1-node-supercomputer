<h1>Setting up a2hosting</h1>

<p>
I have finally gotten a VPS with a2hosting.com, and a domain from hover.com.
</p>
<p>
There are several things I still need to do:
<ol>
	<li> Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt. </li>

	<li> Give my bro access. Two options: run nextcloud instance, or give him
	ssh access. nextcloud is easier for him, ssh easier for me. </li>

	<li> Put my "blog" into markdown or similar format. </li>
</ol>
</p>
