# Upgrading to Debian 11 (bullseye)

Debian 11, codename bullseye, is not yet released. However, you can already
upgrade it while it is in testing.

In principle, the upgrade should be easy: simply update your
`/etc/apt/sources.list` to contain

    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main contrib non-free
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main contrib non-free

    deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free
    deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free

    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main contrib non-free
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main contrib non-free

    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-backports main contrib non-free
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-backports main contrib non-free

Then, run

    $ sudo apt dist-upgrade

Of course, in practice you run into problems along the way. In my case, there
was a dependency issue with `libgcc-8-dev`, which I tracked down (without too
much due diligence, uh oh) to `libmutter-3-0` being locally installed and not
upgraded. So purge that and rerun the dist-upgrade. Done.

Not quite. It takes a long time, the timeout locked the screen, and it wouldn't
even let me enter the password anymore. Argh.

But not to despair, use ssh from another computer (or perhaps `Alt+Ctrl+F2` to
get a console?), and issue the following command:

    $ sudo loginctl unlock-sessions

Voila, screen unlocked!
