<h1>Julia's Hermitian transpose operator</h1>

<p>In <code>Julia</code> the so-called transpose operator does a little more than I expected:</p>

<pre><code>julia&gt; [1+im]'
[1-im]
</code></pre>

<p>That is, it is the Hermitian operator or conjugate-transpose, frequently
abbreviated as a dagger, †.</p>

<p>That means that <code>A' = conj(transpose(A))</code>.</p>

<p>It took me awhile to figure that out. I had always assumed that <code>'</code> is just the
transpose, not taking the complex conjugate. Phew, finally found that.</p>

<p>Does it make sense? Yes, I think so. That is exactly what you will usually
want. Perhaps it would have been nice to use the symbol †, for clarity.</p>

<p>Then again, this was a changed made sometime in the 0.x days of Julia, and it
is only a matter of time until the new meaning is well-known and we are all
used to it.</p>
