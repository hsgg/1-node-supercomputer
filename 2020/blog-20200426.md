# Setting up a2hosting

I have finally gotten a VPS with a2hosting.com, and a domain from hover.com.

There are several things I still need to do:

  - Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt.

  - Give my bro access. Two options: run nextcloud instance, or give him
    ssh access. nextcloud is easier for him, ssh easier for me.

  - Put my "blog" into markdown or similar format.
