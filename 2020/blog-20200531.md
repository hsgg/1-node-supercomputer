# Julia's Hermitian transpose operator

In `Julia` the so-called transpose operator does a little more than I expected:

	julia> [1+im]'
	[1-im]

That is, it is the Hermitian operator, frequently abbreviated as a dagger, †. 

That means that `A' = conj(transpose(A))`.

It took me awhile to figure that out. I had always assumed that `'` is just the
transpose, not taking the complex conjugate. Phew, finally found that.

Does it make sense? Yes, i think so. That is exactly what you will usually
want. Perhaps it would have been nice to use the symbol †, for clarity.
