# Goolge+ Data Litigation

So... Google fucked up. Their dying, now dead, social media platform called
*Google+* had a data breach back when it was still alive.

Crafty [lawyers][1] make loads of money off a lawsuit like this, to the tune of
about [$1,800,000][2], split among six lawyers. That is about $300,000 per
lawyer and their secretary.

Compare that to about $1,500 for the four class representatives.

Compare that to a maximum of $5 to $12 per class-action member.

Is it good or is it bad?

On the one hand, only the law firms are benefitting from this directly. It
appears a waste of resources that could have been spent on more fruitful
endeavours. Did Google become a victim of a legal troll? In this view, the data
breach was too small to warrant any kind of action, and $5-$12 dollars per
person already seems high to me.

On the other hand, in the email Google sent around, the links to the
class-action website are rather peculiar. They don't directly point to the
class-action website, instead pointing to a google.com address that redirects
to the website. That seems odd, but perhaps can be explained by Google wanting
to know who clicks on those links. And why not? I don't blame them. However,
can Google use that against me now? At best, I can no longer claim to have been
unaware. At worst, they may cancel my Google account. Google wont forget this.
It paints a poor picture onto Google. In any case, does this mean Google cares
about the law suit? It knows what it did...

Further on this point, the longer-term implications of such a lawsuit could be
useful to society. The lawyers as the enforcers of privacy law. Doesn't sound
too bad.

What do you think?
