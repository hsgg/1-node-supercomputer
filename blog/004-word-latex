Knauff, Nejasmic 2014.

In this paper Knauff and Nejasmic measure the merits of using Word or LaTeX in
different typesetting scenarios. The article seems to be rather biased towards
Word. The data fairly clearly show that Word is more efficient for typesetting
continous text and tables, whereas LaTeX is better suited for mathematical
equations. They did not test creating graphics. There discussion as to what the
causes are is also rather limited.

I would be interested in a few more details. First, what is an error? They tell
us which kinds of errors they tested for, but are not specific as to what they
were looking for. Clearly the referee of this report didn't do his job. Second,
what about the different editors used for LaTeX? How do people compile their
document? What was their general strategy?

What about other typesetting systems? LyX, or some version of Markdown?
Libreoffice or OpenOffice? They clearly represent a different system. I'd be
interested in those.

I like the research they begin here. It is important, and should allow us to
move towards a better document preparation system.

One final thought. Microsoft word comes from a single company that presumably
is creating a coherent whole. LaTeX on the other hand, is a heterogeneous
collection packages and macros that have grown organically as the need arises.
It seems some of the issues may be fixable.
