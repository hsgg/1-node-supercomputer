# Look, it works!

So, here is my new and shiny webserver! It runs on a NanoPi NEO development
board with the nginx webserver. I'm still figuring out how to configure it.

Currently, the biggest problem is that whenever the DHCP lease expires, and the
device gets a new one, it cannot set a route for the connection anymore. To
debug it, I've written a udev rule to restart the board whenever I insert a USB
stick from whatever the vendor and product IDs are.

Well, actually, I've modified my script to just restart the network connection
using network manager. Hopefully that will be sufficient.

The next lease renewal is due quarter to midnight. I can't wait!

So, yeah, restarting the network interface with `nmcli` is sufficient.
Now, I should report the bug.
