# Installing Mathematica 11 on Archlinux

So I finally decided to buy `Mathematica 11` at the student price
through my university. When it comes to indefinite integrals, I've found
`Mathematica` to be more reliable than my favorite opensource CAD,
`SymPy`. (Yeah, there are others I haven't tried sufficiently, yet...)

So, anyway... I got it, so now I gotta install it on my archlinux laptop, right?

Thankfully, there is an AUR package for Mathematia. I use `yaourt` as a
frontend to AUR. Since Mathematica is a large package, yaourt needs to be
instructed to use a temporary directory that is on disk, not tmpfs mounted. I
do this:

	$ TMPDIR=/var/tmp yaourt -S mathematica

Then, edit the PKGBUILD file so as not to install all the documentation, since
I use the web most of the time anyway. Sure, I may sometimes get in trouble
without internet. Whatever.

While editing the PKGBUILD, it is also important to copy over the Mathematica
install file. Since I use VIM, I do `:shell`, and create a symlink

	$ ln -s /path/to/Mathematica_11.1.1_Install.sh

After exiting the install, just need to say yes a few times, and let the
scripts do their work.
