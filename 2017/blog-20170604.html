<h1>Installing Mathematica 11 on Archlinux</h1>
<p>
So I finally decided to buy <tt>Mathematica 11</tt> at the student price
through my university. When it comes to indefinite integrals, I've found
<tt>Mathematica</tt> to be more reliable than my favorite opensource CAD,
<tt>SymPy</tt>. (Yeah, there are others I haven't tried sufficiently, yet...)
</p>
<p>
So, anyway... I got it, so now I gotta install it on my archlinux laptop, right?
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there is an AUR package for Mathematia. I use <tt>yaourt</tt> as a
frontend to AUR. Since Mathematica is a large package, yaourt needs to be
instructed to use a temporary directory that is on disk, not tmpfs mounted. I
do this:
<blockquote>
<code>$ TMPDIR=/var/tmp yaourt -S mathematica</code>
</blockquote>
Then, edit the PKGBUILD file so as not to install all the documentation, since
I use the web most of the time anyway. Sure, I may sometimes get in trouble
without internet. Whatever.

While editing the PKGBUILD, it is also important to copy over the Mathematica
install file. Since I use VIM, I do <tt>:shell</tt>, and create a symlink
<blockquote>
<code>
$ ln -s /path/to/Mathematica_11.1.1_Install.sh
</code>
</blockquote>
After exiting the install, just need to say yes a few times, and let the
scripts do their work.
