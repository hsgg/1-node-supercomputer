<h1>Look, it works!</h1>
<p>
So, here is my new and shiny webserver! It runs on a NanoPi NEO development
board with the nginx webserver. I'm still figuring out how to configure it.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the biggest problem is that whenever the DHCP lease expires, and the
device gets a new one, it cannot set a route for the connection anymore. To
debug it, I've written a udev rule to restart the board whenever I insert a USB
stick from whatever the vendor and product IDs are.
</p>
<p>
Well, actually, I've modified my script to just restart the network connection
using network manager. Hopefully that will be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
The next lease renewal is due quarter to midnight. I can't wait!
</p>
<p>
So, yeah, restarting the network interface with <tt>nmcli</tt> is sufficient.
Now, I should report the bug.
