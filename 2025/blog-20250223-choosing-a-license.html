<h1 id="choosing-a-license-for-open-source">Choosing a license for open
source</h1>
<p>There are several common licenses to choose out there. Here I will
list what I am looking for in a license for an open source project, and
which ones are out there.</p>
<p>Basically, I want the following for the projects I am currently
thinking about:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Unrestricted usage: I want to allow the software to be used in
any way people see fit. I don’t want to limit how it is used, and I
don’t want to impose a license on their work either.</p></li>
<li><p>Reciprocity: If you take my code and modify it, I want to be able
to merge those modifications back.</p></li>
<li><p>Patent protection and limited liability: I don’t want be held
liable for anything, and both parties are protected from patent claims
from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplicity: I want it in one not-too-long file, readable in one
sitting. Simplicity also implies popularity: If you choose a different
license from everyone else, you will make a lot of people <a
href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/package-license/7109/4">grouchy</a>
and annoyed. This is because different licenses will make it just that
little bit harder to share and change. For one, contributors will need
to become familiar with the new license.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other people and other projects may have different requirements. For
example, Stefan Karpinski <a
href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/package-license/7109/15">made a
good point</a> that infrastructure-like software can get away with a
more permissive license than an end-user product intended to be
sold.</p>
<p>The kinds of projects I am thinking about fall somewhere in-between.
I don’t expect the number of users to be very large, ever, so I am not
concerned about monetization. On the other hand, I think it is far
enough along the toolchain to warrant reciprocity. That is, that
modifications can always be merged back.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is also a matter of fairness. I share my code, and if
someone else benefits from it makes modifications that I could benefit
from as well, then I want those back. You taketh, you giveth.</p>
<p>The rest of the points above are really just practical
considerations.</p>
<p>The licenses I am considering are the following, roughly <a
href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/">sorted</a> by how
restrictive they are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>GPL: GNU General Public License</li>
<li>LGPL: GNU Lesse General Public License</li>
<li>MPL: Mozilla Public License Version 2.0</li>
<li>EUPL: European Public License Version 1.2</li>
<li>Apache: Apache License Version 2.0</li>
<li>MIT License</li>
<li>BSD License</li>
</ol>
<p>Another good site for comparison is the <a
href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/joinup-licensing-assistant-jla">License
Assistant</a>.</p>
<p>First, let’s start throwing out licenses: The GPL is too viral. It
imposes on programs using GPL’d code that they also need to be GPL. That
seems a little too much imposing for my projects.</p>
<p>Next, BSD is very similar to MIT, but the Julia ecosystem is mostly
on MIT, so no reason to choose BSD for me. The ecosystem argument is a
strong one, so MIT is still in the running, but it lacks reciprocity, so
I prefer not to.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Apache license is stronger than MIT, but also lacks
reciprocity.</p>
<p>So I am left with LGPL, MPL, and EUPL. (And maybbe GPLv2-only, but I
don’t want to open that hornest’s nest.)</p>
<p>The LGPL is a mess. I am not even sure if there is a single document
for it. Otherwise, I probably would consider it.</p>
<p>We are left with MPL and EUPL. The EUPL appears to be a little more
annoying to deal with, requiring to be explicit about what changes
someone else made. But probably a good license.</p>
<p>The MPL seems to fit my purpose quite nicely. It is relatively short,
appears to be legally robust by not leaving too much open for
interpretation, has all the protections in it, and ensures reciprocity.
What’s not to like?</p>
<p>So with the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/">MPL</a>,
people can use the software as they see fit, and modifications need to
be under the same license.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I am a big fan of oversimplification: <a
href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/package-licenses-contemplations-and-considerations/117922/9">MPL/EUPL
= MIT + more robust legalese + reciprocity + credit</a>.</p>
