<h1 id="tax-preparation-incentives">Tax Preparation Incentives</h1>
<p>Taxes! Again! Tax preparation software! Ugh!</p>
<p>I already expounded the flaws and inefficiencies of the American tax
season <a href="../2020/blog-20200621.html">here</a>. Why tax
preparation companies lobby for a complex tax system, how the IRS could
do it more efficiently, how Americans waste hours every year on their
taxes.</p>
<p>The upshot (downshot?) is that tax preparation companies have an
incentive to prevent the tax system from getting better, because if it
was good, they wouldn’t be needed.</p>
<p>The best fix is to fix the incentive. What kind of entity or business
model would have the incentive to lobby for a better system? What
company would benefit form a nicer tax system?</p>
<p>Maybe one of the small preparation companies, if they think they can
get a government contract to do it for the IRS.</p>
<p>Or, most small businesses that wouldn’t have complicated taxes.</p>
<p>And individual tax payers.</p>
<p>Not much in the way of anyone who thoroughly understands the current
tax system.</p>
<p>However, there is one hope: charities. United Way has
myfreetaxes.com. They are powered by one of them tax preparation
companies, but, ultimately, their incentive is to make it is easier to
pay taxes. Unfortunately, as a charity, they don’t have the same clout
as a business, and, I believe, they are forbidden from lobbying.</p>
