<h1>Voter Suppression vs. Election Integrity</h1>

<p>Some people (predominantly democrats) are concerned about voter suppression.</p>

<p>Other people (predominantly republicans) are concerned about election integrity.</p>

<p>Both concerns can be addressed at the same time.</p>

<p>It does not matter whether either of these concerns is valid or not. What does
matter is that both can be addressed so that most people will accept the result
of the next election.</p>

<p>And in any case, if neither or just one of the concerns is real, fixing both
will still leave us with a better democracy.</p>

<p>First, how about <strong>automatic voter registration and de-registration</strong>? Here is
how it works. Every citizen gets automatically registered in their home county.
If you move, you get de-registered in your old home county when you register in
the new one. Everyone citizen is registered exactly once - no more, no less.
Now, maybe there are some subtleties getting it to work across states, but
what's not to like?</p>

<p>Second, one could require <strong>voter ID and make the voter ID free</strong> for every
voting-age citizen. If everyone has to pay for it, might as well make it free,
right? Driver's licenses for voters would have an extra mark indicating they
can vote, driver's licenses for aliens would lack that mark. What's not to
like?</p>

<p>Third, have <strong>sufficient number of polling places</strong> in accessible locations,
have them <strong>open long enough</strong> for everyone to vote, and let people sit and
drink in line. This is just basic human decency, but, yes, I admit this only
addresses the voter suppression concern. Still, what's not to like?</p>

<p>Finally, how about <strong>voting on July 4th</strong>? No better way to celebrate our
freedom than by casting a vote. No need for a new holiday. Use the one we are
all proud of and that got us in this mess in the first place.</p>
