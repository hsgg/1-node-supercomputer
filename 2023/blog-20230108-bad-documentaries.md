# Most Documentaries are Bad

I've been watching waaayyy too many documentaries lately. Anything from why this country does this and that, why trains or why not trains, or mathematics this and physics that.

For a concrete example, let's take [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXvSawDj4iQ) documentary on why Switzerland is so rich. I am not picking on this in particular, most others do the same mistake.

So why is Switzerland so rich? The number here is that the Swiss have a mean of $700,000 per person. The median is at $168,000.

The US has a mean of $580,000 per person and a median of $93,000. Germany is at a mean of $257,000 and a median of $60,600.

So the Swiss are quite rich. Why?

[The documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXvSawDj4iQ) argues that a significant part of that is due to its political stability. Remember the world wars? Me neither, but we all learned about them, and they destroyed a lot of value all over Europe. Once reason Germany is significantly poorer, or so the argument.

The argument makes sense. Maybe it doesn't account for all the difference (the documentary also mentions education, global commodities trade, and a few other things).

However, to show that the wars are one important reason, I want to see the mean wealth per person as a function of time. That graph should include the world wars. The expectation is to see a significant reduction in Germany's wealth, and maybe only a little for the Swiss and Americans.

Why is the documentary not showing such a graph? What is it that makes the narrator say so confidently that the world wars are a reason (not the only reason) for Swiss wealth? Did they see such a graph? If they did, why don't they show it? Is it hard to make such a graph? They don't give an alternative explanation.

So here is my gripe: The documentary fails to present a convincing argument why we should believe them, and seems like such an argument is available. I complain that the argumentation is not good enough. We have to take the narrator by their words. We as viewers are left out of the full argumentation. An argument needs more than to be internally consistent. We need to hear the reasoning that leads us to believe these claims.

As it stands, the documentary provides little more than unverified claims of what could be the cause, and some reasoning to establish plausibility.
