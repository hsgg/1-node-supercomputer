# Closed-loop Hydro

Some people think closed-loop hydro is the solution to electric grid storage.
Somtimes this is also called *Pumped Hydro Storage* (PHS) or variations
therefore.

It entails having two reservoirs: one on top of a mountain, one in the valley.
To store electricity, pump water up the mountain. To release it, run the water
down through generators.

The [Australian
study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918305270#b0215)
claims up to 300 times the needed capacity exists on the planet. Perusing their
[atlas](https://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global/), they may be a little optimistic.
However, they do exclude regions that are currently in other use like cities
and much agricultural land, so not too bad, either.

Their [atlas](https://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global/) is really cool.

On the other hand, for the US now, NREL has a (perhaps) more realistic
[study](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/psh-supply-curves.html), also with map and
all.

Most pumped hydro storage is available in mountainous regions, like the Rockies
or the Apalachians.

Northern and Western Europe doesn't have much capacity.
